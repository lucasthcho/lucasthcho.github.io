Hi Niko!!

I took your course and it was really fun and challenging at the same time. I'm currently serving my military duty now and I work on projects
with this shitty computer with a LOT of restrictions. For example, the terminal does not work, so I could not publish branch after all the work.
So I asked one of my friend and he helped me to upload file manually and use github pages. I might have some problem on the project since I have not
followed the original way, but I hope you understand it. Thanks for your hard work and have a nice day!

Sincerely,
Lucas Cho
